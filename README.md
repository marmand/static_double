Static Double
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marmand/static_double.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marmand/static_double)

This project is based on a simple idea that we don't currently have double
computation at compile-time.

As such, before knowing of constexpr, I started implementing a double
computations at compile-time.

Contributing
------------

As I'm currently only reseting bases of this project, I'll only take ideas and
suggestions. But I plan on having a contributing plan soon.
